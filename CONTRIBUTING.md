We are always very grateful to researchers who report vulnerabilities responsibly.

## Development

We recommend using Python 3.10 – 3.13. Python 3.14+ is not supported (grpcio wheels unavailable).


### Contribution Guidelines

- **Code Style**: Follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines
- **Testing**: Test your changes using `examples/example.py` and `examples/ui_example.py`
- **Documentation**: Update the README.md if you're adding new features or changing behavior
- **Commit Messages**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- **Pull Requests**: 
  - Provide a clear description of your changes
  - Reference any related issues
  - Ensure your code works with Python 3.10-3.13
- **Logging**: Use structured logging instead of `print()` statements (see [Logging Guidelines](#logging-guidelines) below)


### General Steps for Contributing (Creating a Pull Request)

1. Fork the project.

2. Clone your fork.

```
# Clone the repository (fork)
git clone https://github.com/cyberark/Vulnhalla.git
cd Vulnhalla
```

3. Install the project's requirements and configure your environment. See [README.md](README.md) for detailed instructions on installing dependencies, setting up CodeQL packs, and configuring your `.env` file.

4. Make local changes to your fork by editing files

5. Test your changes

```
# Test the full pipeline
python examples/example.py

# Test UI changes (if applicable)
python examples/ui_example.py
```

6. Commit your changes. Use clear, descriptive commit messages.

7. Push your local changes to the remote server.

8. Create a new Pull Request. Please include:
   - A clear description of your changes
   - Reference to any related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
   - Any testing you performed

From here, your pull request will be reviewed, and once it is merged into the project. Congratulations, you're a contributor!

### Reporting Issues

Before reporting issues, please:
- Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
- Include Python version, OS, and error messages
- Provide steps to reproduce the issue

## Logging Guidelines

Vulnhalla uses centralized logging. Always use `get_logger(__name__)` instead of `print()` for application messages.

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.utils.logger import get_logger

logger = get_logger(__name__)

# ✅ Good
logger.info("Processing database: %s", db_path)
logger.warning("Rate limit approaching: %d requests remaining", remaining)
logger.error("Failed to process: %s", error_message)
logger.debug("Debug information: %s", debug_data)

# ❌ Bad
print("Processing database:", db_path)  # Don't use print()
```

### Log Levels

- **`logger.debug()`** - Detailed diagnostics (shown with `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`)
- **`logger.info()`** - Status updates, progress messages
- **`logger.warning()`** - Warnings (rate limits, missing data)
- **`logger.error()`** - Errors, failures, exceptions

### When Print() is Acceptable

`print()` is only acceptable for:
- Interactive CLI prompts
- Real-time progress indicators with `\r` (e.g., download progress bars)

## Testing

Please test your changes manually using the example scripts:

- `python examples/example.py` - Tests the full pipeline
- `python examples/ui_example.py` - Tests the UI

Ensure your code works with Python 3.10-3.13 before submitting.

**Testing with Different Log Levels:**
```bash
# Test with debug logging
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG python examples/example.py

# Test with warning level only
LOG_LEVEL=WARNING python examples/example.py
```
