The static analyzer flagged a security configuration issue (cookie flags, header settings, or similar).
1. What specific misconfiguration was detected — missing HttpOnly flag, missing Secure flag, missing SameSite attribute, exposed debug information?
2. For cookie flags: retrieve the setcookie() or setrawcookie() call and confirm which flags are set. Are HttpOnly and Secure present?
3. Is this cookie used for session management or authentication? If yes, missing flags are higher severity.
4. Is this code path reachable by unauthenticated users, or only authenticated?
5. For missing Secure flag: is the site expected to operate over HTTPS only, or is HTTP also supported? Missing Secure flag on HTTP-only sites has no practical impact.
Note: MUST_VERIFY_DEFINITION findings require manual confirmation — the static analyzer could not fully resolve the call. Verify the actual setcookie() signature before classifying.
